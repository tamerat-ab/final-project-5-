This human resource management system application has its own distinctive as well as complexity nature
First of all this project has no any similarity with any of the projects so far has been mentioned in the project specifications such as , social network application ,e-commerce or any other application so far has been developed. Besides, the application is mobile-responsive one.
The other most important distinctive features are that it comprises of all human resource management elements in it. By simply implementing this application in any business entity, one can reduce the hurdle of dealing with a time consuming task by providing ample leeway for both the managerial body and employees. It also reduces the amount of physical material input thereby reducing the administration cost of a company .the other distinctive feature of the application is that it is highly user friendly which introduces the user with understandable textual messages and stepwise guidance.
The project is complex and dynamics   because the codes were written in a complex manner in such a way that they address important elements of the application in user friendly and dynamic manner. The frontend code (which is written by JavaScript) has its own higher complexity level so as to alleviate a better user experience. The backend code (which is written in python with Django framework) handles the complex database manipulation operations, and all the CRUD task in highly efficient and complex manner, and contains also seven models.
The frontend code alone is thousands of lines of codes written a high quality level so as to deliver a much efficient user experience. On the other hand the back end code is more than half a thousand lines long that enhances the experience of dealing with the database and CRUD operations.
"##Folder tree:"

"##Employee registration and data insertion"
A user, in this case an employee (employee and user could be used interchangeably) first register himself as a newly hired employee by creating an account in the employer’s database. For this to happen, as the employee first register himself he is redirected the newly employee form and the form persists there insists the employee until the he/she fills it up and submit it, as a result the employer or the manager access the user’s newly entered information on his admin control page to which the manager only is an authorized person. Additionally, the user has an access to upload his profile picture. Here, as his information or data is sensitive enough and should not be changed any time, the user should get a permission to update his information for the second time from the manager. For this to happen, the employee could put his request with the manager so that he could permitted to update his information in case he committed some mistakes while he was filling up the form.
"##Employee time control:"
In this part the employee can go to time controlling page and notify the manager whether he is on work or not. Besides this, when this time keeping button is toggled the following operations could take place at the background
1.	The amount of time the employee has been on work is calculated and reported 
2.	The amount of wage the employee earned  is calculated and reported
3.	The total time he has been on work is calculated and reported
However if the time of toggling the button is not the office hour registered in the system or if the employee has already filled up a leave form ,then he would get different messages( such as , ‘this is not working hour’ ,you are on leave now-if the user has already filled up a leave form , or ‘welcome back to work-if the user has been on break’ ,’you started work- if he was on leave or started work on the next working day)
"##Chat box":
In the employees contact button , the user can access short information about whom he/she going to communicate with ( information such as; department position name …) then if the employee contact is the one that the user wanted to talk to, then the user can easily start chatting instantly with the intended employee contact within the app. And could channel his concern or issues without physically presenting himself.
"##Administrator page:"
This page can only be accessed with different account other or only by administrator having special access permission .in this pages the administrator or the manager can access all relevant information about the individual employee. Beside this, the administrator can see the timeline of every employee and could check who is on job and who is not , and also the current earning or (wage) progress. 
Additionally the manager can set a wage rate for every employee and this wage rate appears on every employee’s page and then the earned wage changes accordingly form the very time the wage rate has changed.
The other feature in this page is that. The administrator can give permission to an employee to update or correct any flaw in the already submitted application form. The application form technically is all the information about individual employee and for that matter the employee should not have access to make any change about the information in his application form unless the manager /administrator gives permission. Hence, the administrator can grant permission or deny permission from this page.
"##The statistics page:"
In this page the user can see his earning and time progress live. On  the  bar chart  provided, the employee can see his current earning ,wage rate , the total amount of time he has been on work.
"##Leave reporting and canceling:"
An employee can fill up a leave form without personally going to the administrator by justifying his reason. Furthermore, whenever the employee is ready to go back to work he/she could cancel his/her leave form in the user’s own page and can resume work. When doing so, the employee can only fill up a leave form once at a time and the previously filled up leave has to be cancelled so that he/she could fill up a new form.
"##Updating profile photo:"
The employee could update his profile picture unlike the application form updating which requires the manager’s permission to update.
